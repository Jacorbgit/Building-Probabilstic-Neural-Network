# Building-Probabilstic-Neural-Network
## Explanation of the file(s) in this Repository:

### Neural_Network.py
This is the central file for this project. This file is simply my program to build a probabilstic ( outputs a probability between 0 and 1 for a binary classification task) in python. This is an early draft so a lot of modification is needed. The program is designed to highlight understanding of the CORE concepts regarding neural network consruction such as epochs, backpropogation, forward pass, and gradient descent. As time goes on this file (and entire repo) will be updated. Open to help, suggestions, pull request, questions, comments, and criticms!
